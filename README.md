# Resume
This is my personal website. Here you can find interesting things!

It is available at [dahl.dev](https://dahl.dev)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.1.0.

# Running
This is notes for myself mostly, so dont expect too much

1. I dislike installing global npm packages, this is what angular tells you to do, so instead use npx (install with npm)
2. Then install the node modules that are in package.json normally (npm install)
3. now run npx ng serve
