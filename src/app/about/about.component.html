                <p>My name is Alex and welcome to my internet home.
                    I am currently working as a Data Engineer at
                    <a href="https://ica.se" target="_blank">
                        ICA</a>, Sweden's
                    largest retailer. The ICA customers' generate a lot of data,
                    and that data goes into data pipelines,
                    which I am building and maintaining.
                    You can read more about it in my Resume, which is linked in the top right.

                <h4>Interests</h4>
                <h6><b>DevOps for Data</b></h6>
                <p>The fields of Data Engineering and Data Science are both quite young
                    without processes and practices that have been battle tested.
                    I am interested in how can I spend as little time as possible on fixing
                    leaking pipelines and instead focus on delivering value to the business,
                    which is what I am getting paid for. How can automate testing of data, pipeline
                    deployment and so on? Then the other question is how can we build applications
                    that are easily built, configured and deployed?
                </p>
                <p>Yeah so basically:</p>

                <h6><b>(Data) Architecture</b></h6>
                <p>
                    Another area of interest is which Architecture should be used for software projects.
                    I had servers that were running in a cluster mode by a hypervisor called
                    <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/" target="_blank">
                        proxmox</a> in my wardrobe, but downsized just one server with quite a lot
                    of RAM that I only run docker containers on. You can read more about this server
                    in the projects section. <small>(I also think Bauhaus is pretty cool)</small>
                </p>
                <h6><b>Bicycle Touring</b></h6>
                <p>I rode my bicycle from Connecticut, USA to San Jose, Costa Rica in 2016-2017.
                    That was pretty cool! It was approximately 10000km. My bike computer broke after
                    7000km and southern Mexico is not the best place to replace a bike computer.
                    It was quite an adventure and it would be cool to do it again some time,
                    but on another continent.
                </p>
                <p>This was my route:</p>

                <h6><b>Fermentation and brewing</b></h6>
                <p>I like fermenting things. I almost always have homemade kimchi in my fridge.
                    I also bake a sourdough loaf on Sundays. Then I do some homebrewing when the
                    passion is there. Last I did Sake, japanese rice wine. It was really cool because
                    it introduced me to koji, a japanese fungus/mold that transforms the starch in
                    the rice to sugar, which the yeast can then eat to produce alcohol.
                    It was a cool experiment!
                </p>
                <h6><b>Arch Linux</b></h6>
                I run Arch Linux on my laptop. It's great!
