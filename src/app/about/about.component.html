                <p>My name is Alex and welcome to my internet home.
                    I am currently working as a Data Engineer at
                    <a href="https://www.icagruppen.se/en/about-ica-gruppen" target="_blank">
                        ICA</a>, Sweden's
                    largest retailer. The ICA customers' generate a lot of data,
                    and that data goes into data pipelines,
                    which I am building and maintaining.
                    You can read more about it in my Resume, which is linked in the top right.

                <h6><b>DevOps for Data</b></h6>
                <p>The fields of Data Engineering and Data Science are both quite young
                    without processes and practices that have been battle tested.
                    I am interested in how can I spend as little time as possible on fixing
                    leaking pipelines and instead focus on delivering value to the business,
                    which is what I am getting paid for. How can automate testing of data, pipeline
                    deployment and so on? Then the other question is how can we build applications
                    that are easily built, configured and deployed?
                </p>
                <p>Yeah so basically:</p>

                <del>I run Arch Linux on my laptop. It's great!</del> It took 10 months until
                I bricked my Arch Linux distro and I now use 
                <a href="https://pop.system76.com/">Pop!_OS</a>
                instead. I think desktop linux gets a bad rap and it can be very easy to use
                and user friendly if you choose the right distro, like Pop!_OS.
                I also think that shell is an amazing tool, and I like making
                shell scripts to automate anything that would take more than 5 minutes
                to do manually.

                <p>
                    I am currently running a small cluster of Raspberry Pis at home, 
                    which dutifully sent this website to you. I am using
                    <a href="https://traefik.io/" target="_blank">traefik</a>
                    as my reverse proxy. Traefik routes my subdomains to exposed docker containers
                    and will automatically enable https on them too. This makes it
                    really easy to spin up new services! It is as simple as just defining
                    a label for which address the docker container should listen to.
                    In the below picture you can see an overview of the architecture,
                    and how the different containers interact with each other.
                </p>
                <p>Before I had a draw io diagram for this, but now I generate this picture with
                    code using <a href="https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/">Diagrams as Code</a>.
                    The code for the below picture can be seen <a

                <p>This website is automatically deployed to the server when new commits are pushed
                    to the master branch. The website is an angular application, which can be viewed
                    on <a href="https://github.com/aleda145/resumewebpage">github</a>. I have set up
                    <a href="https://www.drone.io/">drone</a>, which is a self hosted CI/CD service that will
                    get a hook from github whenever a new commit is pushed to master. The drone runner
                    can be viewed on 
                    <a href="https://drone.dahl.dev/aleda145/resumewebpage/">drone.dahl.dev/aleda145/resumewebpage/</a>.
                    The runner will build the supplied Dockerfile in the repo, and sent it up to my
                    <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/aleda145">dockerhub account</a>.
                    Then I have <a href="https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower">Watchtower</a> running in a
                    container. Watchtower will poll the docker image every 30 seconds,
                    and if it notices
                    a change in docker images, it will pull the image, create a new container and
                    start the service. This will result in a downtime for the website of around 1 second,
                    which is acceptable since I get very little traffic :)

                    <h5 id="LARM"><b>Head of IT at LARM</b></h5>
                    <p>I was head of IT for <a href="https://larm.lintek.liu.se/">LARM</a> in 2019.
                        I did some cool things to make the fair run as smoothly as possible.
                        I launched the usage of RFID readers for checking into events. The previous process
                        was students walking up to a desk, stating their name and were checked off in an
                        Excel sheet. This was a tedious process that took at least 10 minutes when you have
                        300 students going to an event. My implementation meant that the students could check
                        themselves in with their student card, and they were automatically registered in the database.
                        Taking the check in time down to less than 5 minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another thing was the scheduling of interviews during the fair day. These
                        interviews are typical in Sweden, where they are called "kontaktsamtal".
                        Since most career fairs are only one day it is hard to create a
                        schedule that works for all companies as well as the students.
                        To further complicate things, students that are chosen
                        for one interview are usually also chosen for another,
                        making it very hard to successfully schedule this. When updating
                        one student, the errors will cascade and it will be a big mess.
                        This whole process took around 40 hours of full time work for two workers.
                        After some contemplation I figured out that this was an
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem">assignment problem</a>.
                        After some debating with my local optimization professor, shout out to
                        <a href="https://users.mai.liu.se/nilqu94/">Nils-Hassan!</a>
                        I arrived at the following optimization problem:
                    </p>
                    <div class="col-md-12 justify-content-center">
                        <img src="/assets/model.png" class="img-fluid">
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Which could then be solved with an optimization solver. I chose Gurobi for this.
                        See the code
                        <a href="https://github.com/aleda145/interview-scheduling-kontaktsamtal-">
                        here</a>.
                        If I had done this again today I would have used Google's
                    <a href="https://developers.google.com/optimization">OR tools</a> instead.

                    <h6 id="bike"><b>Bicycle Touring</b></h6>
                    <p>I rode my bicycle from Connecticut, USA to San Jose, Costa Rica in 2016-2017.
                        That was pretty cool! It was approximately 10000km. My bike computer broke after
                        7000km and southern Mexico is not the best place to replace a bike computer,
                        so I can't know for sure!
                    </p>
                    <p>This was my route:</p>

                    <h6><b>Fermentation and brewing</b></h6>
                    <p>I like fermenting things. I almost always have homemade kimchi in my fridge.
                        Then I also do some homebrewing. Last I did Sake, japanese rice wine. It was really cool because
                        it introduced me to koji, a japanese fungus/mold that transforms the starch in
                        the rice to sugar, which the yeast can then eat to produce alcohol.
