                <p>My name is Alex and welcome to my internet home.
                    I am currently working as a Data Engineer at
                    <a href="https://www.icagruppen.se/en/about-ica-gruppen" target="_blank">
                        ICA</a>, Sweden's
                    largest retailer. The ICA customers' generate a lot of data,
                    and that data goes into data pipelines,
                    which I am building and maintaining.
                    You can read more about it in my Resume, which is linked in the top right.

                <h4>Interests</h4>
                <h6><b>DevOps for Data</b></h6>
                <p>The fields of Data Engineering and Data Science are both quite young
                    without processes and practices that have been battle tested.
                    I am interested in how can I spend as little time as possible on fixing
                    leaking pipelines and instead focus on delivering value to the business,
                    which is what I am getting paid for. How can automate testing of data, pipeline
                    deployment and so on? Then the other question is how can we build applications
                    that are easily built, configured and deployed?
                </p>
                <p>Yeah so basically:</p>

                <h6><b>(Data) Architecture</b></h6>
                <p>
                    Another area of interest is which Architecture should be used for software projects.
                    I had servers that were running in a cluster mode by a hypervisor called
                    <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/" target="_blank">
                        proxmox</a> in my wardrobe, but downsized just one server with quite a lot
                    of RAM that I only run docker containers on. You can read more about this server
                    in the projects section. <small>(I also think Bauhaus is pretty cool)</small>
                </p>
                <h6><b>Bicycle Touring</b></h6>
                <p>I rode my bicycle from Connecticut, USA to San Jose, Costa Rica in 2016-2017.
                    That was pretty cool! It was approximately 10000km. My bike computer broke after
                    7000km and southern Mexico is not the best place to replace a bike computer.
                    It was quite an adventure and it would be cool to do it again some time,
                    but on another continent.
                </p>
                <p>This was my route:</p>

                <h6><b>Fermentation and brewing</b></h6>
                <p>I like fermenting things. I almost always have homemade kimchi in my fridge.
                    I also bake a sourdough loaf on Sundays. Then I do some homebrewing when the
                    passion is there. Last I did Sake, japanese rice wine. It was really cool because
                    it introduced me to koji, a japanese fungus/mold that transforms the starch in
                    the rice to sugar, which the yeast can then eat to produce alcohol.
                    It was a cool experiment!
                </p>
                <h6><b>Arch Linux</b></h6>
                I run Arch Linux on my laptop. It's great!

                <p>A showcase of interesting projects I have been working on</p>
                <h5 id="homeserver"><b>Home Server</b></h5>
                <p>
                    I am currently running a server at home, which dutifully sent this website
                    to you. It is running debian with a bunch of docker containers. I am using
                    <a href="https://traefik.io/" target="_blank">traefik</a>
                    as my reverse proxy. Traefik routes my subdomains to exposed docker containers
                    and will automatically enable https on them too. This makes it
                    really easy to spin up new services! It is as simple as just defining
                    a label for which address the docker container should listen to.
                    In the below picture you can see an overview of the architecture,
                    and how the different containers interact with each other.
                </p>
                <div class="col-md-12 justify-content-center">

                </div>
                <h5 id="elastic"><b>Elastic</b></h5>
                <p>I have an elastic stack running on docker, as seen in the picture above.
                    I am using the normal elastic stack, so Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana and
                    Beats(Filebeat and Metricbeat). I send my authentication logs from the debian server
                    containing all the addresses of hackers trying to hack my server to Logstash.
                    Logstash then processes it for Elasticsearch, which is then
                    sent to a dashboard in Kibana, that can be viewed
                    <a
                        href="https://ssh.dahl.dev/s/public/app/dashboards#/view/45c53a50-2b7a-11eb-8138-5526e648ee71?_g=(filters%3A!()%2CrefreshInterval%3A(pause%3A!f%2Cvalue%3A30000)%2Ctime%3A(from%3A'2020-11-14T17%3A14%3A00.319Z'%2Cto%3Anow))">
                        here!</a>

                </p>
                <p>Below is a sample of what you would get in the full dashboard:</p>
                <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
                    <iframe class="embed-responsive-item"
                        src="https://ssh.dahl.dev/s/public/app/dashboards#/view/38f3a090-6e33-11eb-881e-e7c2c83fd49b?embed=true&_g=(filters%3A!()%2CrefreshInterval%3A(pause%3A!f%2Cvalue%3A15000)%2Ctime%3A(from%3A'2020-11-14T17%3A00%3A00.000Z'%2Cto%3Anow))&hide-filter-bar=true">
                    </iframe>
                </div>
                <p>To make a public dashboard for a locked down elastic stack was surprisingly
                    not that hard, all that was needed was passing login credentials headers for a
                    guest user that has very little privileges. I followed this guide for that:
